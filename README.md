This is a code that uses the pymultinest package ([Feroz et al. 2009](); [Buchner et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...564A.125B/abstract)) to fit Lyman-alpha (Lyα) damping-wing absorption, both from the IGM and local damped-Lyα absorbing (DLA) systems. The main functionality has been described in [D'Eugenio et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231109908D/abstract).
